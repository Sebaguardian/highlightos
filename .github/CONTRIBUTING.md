# Contributing
❤️ Firstly, big thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️
## Recommendations
* When working on "bigger" changes, consider [opening an Issue](https://github.com/adamperkowski/highlightos/issues/new/choose) first, and then [linking a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to it.
* Try making commit messages and descriptions as detailed as possible.
* If it's your first time contributing to a project then you should check out the [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repository. This will give you hands-on experience with the features of GitHub required to make a contribution.
